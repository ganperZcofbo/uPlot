# How to Fix the "No Export DLLs Found" Error in Crystal Reports
 
Crystal Reports is a popular reporting tool that allows you to create and export reports to various formats, such as PDF, Excel, and Word. However, sometimes you may encounter an error message that says "No Export DLLs Found" when you try to export a report from Crystal Reports or from a VB6 application that uses the Crystal Reports ActiveX Designer Runtime (CRAXDRT).
 
This error means that Crystal Reports cannot find the DLL files that are required for exporting to different formats. These DLL files are usually located in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\2.0\bin` folder or the `C:\WINDOWS\Crystal` folder, depending on your version of Crystal Reports. Some of the common DLL files that are used for exporting are:

- `crtslv.dll`: The Crystal Reports formula evaluator.
- `ExportModeller.dll`: The Crystal Reports export engine.
- `crxf_pdf.dll`: The PDF export format DLL.
- `crxf_xls.dll`: The Excel export format DLL.
- `crxf_wordw.dll`: The Word export format DLL.

If these DLL files are missing, corrupted, or not registered properly, you may get the "No Export DLLs Found" error. To fix this error, you can try the following solutions:

1. Check if the DLL files exist in the correct folder. If not, you can copy them from another computer that has Crystal Reports installed or from the installation CD.
2. Register the DLL files using the `regsvr32` command. For example, to register the `crtslv.dll` file, you can run this command in the command prompt: `regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\2.0\bin\crtslv.dll"`. You may need to run the command prompt as an administrator.
3. Repair or reinstall Crystal Reports from the Add/Remove Programs feature in Windows. This may fix any corrupted or missing files or registry entries.
4. Add the location of the Crystal Reports bin folder to the PATH environment variable. This may help Crystal Reports find the DLL files more easily. To do this, you can follow these steps:
    1. Right-click on My Computer and select Properties.
    2. Select the Advanced tab and click on Environment Variables.
    3. In the System Variables section, find the PATH variable and click on Edit.
    4. Add a semicolon (;) at the end of the existing value and then type in the path to the Crystal Reports bin folder. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Crystal Decisions\2.0\bin`.
    5. Click OK to save the changes and close all windows.

By following these solutions, you should be able to fix the "No Export DLLs Found" error in Crystal Reports and export your reports successfully. If you still have problems, you can contact SAP support or visit their online community for more help.
